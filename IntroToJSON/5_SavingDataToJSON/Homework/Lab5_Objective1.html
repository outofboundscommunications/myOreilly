Objective 1:

In our To-Do List application, we use XMLHttpRequest in two functions for two different purposes: We first use it in the function getTodoData() to load existing to-do items from the files todo.json when the application first runs (when the user loads the todo.html web page). We then use it in the function saveTodoData() to send a request containing all the to-do items in the URL so that the save.php script can save the items in the file todo.json.

Even though we don't expect data back from the server when we send the request to save the data, the server does send back a response; just like when we send the request to retrieve the data, the response contains information about the readyState of the request, as well as the status of the request.

Three common status responses from web servers include:

200: Everything is okay
500: Server error
404: Page (or script) not found

(1) Modify the saveTodoData() so that the function can receive information from the server about the readyState and test for each of these status values, and displays a message with the status either in the web page or in the console.

(2) Once you've implemented the updated version of the function, try adding a new to-do item. What message do you see?

(3) Now, temporarily rename the save.php script. Now try to add a new to-do item. What message do you see now?

(4) Change the name of your PHP script back to save.php and verify that it's working correctly by adding a few new to-do items to your list. Reload the page a few times to make sure they are getting saved correctly.

When your project is working to your satisfaction, hand in your html, js, json, and php files.
