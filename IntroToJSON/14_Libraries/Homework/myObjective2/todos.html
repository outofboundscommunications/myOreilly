Objective 2:
In your final project, you're going to add more features to the To-Do List application based on what you've learned in the previous few lessons.

Start with the code from your project from the Strings lesson. Your completed To-Do List application should support the following features:

Use Local Storage (not Ajax) for storing to-do items.
Support deleting to-do items. <--- existing
Support marking to-do items as done. <---- existing
Support a basic text search over the "task" and "who" fields (so I can search by person or word in task). <---existing
Support for dates, showing how many days until a task is due, or how many days overdue a task is. <--- completed
Use Exception handling for potential errors in Date processing.
Support Geolocation, so a task has a location associated with it.
Use Modernizr to separate Local Storage and Geolocation code from the main code. Your application should still function properly (although, obviously, with less capability) even if Local Storage and Geolocation are not supported.

Below, we've included code you can begin with if you don't want to use your existing code. You'll add any new features listed above to the code below (which is from the Strings lab).

Document your code by adding comments explaining what you're doing and why. Submit all your files once you have the application working, including:

Your HTML file.
Your CSS file.
Five JavaScript files
Your Modernizr file
