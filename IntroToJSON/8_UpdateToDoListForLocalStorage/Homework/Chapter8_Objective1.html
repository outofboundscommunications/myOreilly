<!--Create an simple application that uses a form to accept five colors and stores those colors in Local Storage. Just like the To-Do List application, your colors program should display the colors you add to Local Storage in a list, and if you reload the page, you should see the colors you've already added in the list, before you add more.

Things to keep in mind as you implement this project:
Pick a good key to store your colors.
Make sure your colors program knows which items in Local Storage are okay to use (using the appropriate key).
When the user clicks the "submit" button, you'll store all the colors entered in the form.
If the user enters more colors after you've reloaded the page, don't overwrite the existing colors in the list.
If the user leaves some of the form inputs empty, make sure your program handles that correctly.
You can use just simple list items to display the colors (no need to get fancy with the HTML).
You can use an array to store the colors if you want, but you don't have to.
The colors you add can be simple string values, so no need to use JSON to stringify and parse the values you store.
