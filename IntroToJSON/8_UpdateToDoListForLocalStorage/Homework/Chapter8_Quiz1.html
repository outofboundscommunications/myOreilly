<!--Question 1:
We said it's a good idea to use a key that is specific to the application in which you're using that key/value Local Storage item, so that your application knows which items it should use.

Can you think of another good reason to use keys that are specific to the application in which they are used?

So you dont have any conflicts with other applications who could possibly be using the same key/value pair.

Question 2:
If you create and use another application at the same domain (userworld.com) that runs the following line of code, what will happen to your to-do list items in Local Storage?

localStorage.clear();

It deletes the data in local storage!

Question 3:
In the lesson, we displayed a console message if the user's browser doesn't support local storage. What's a better option for handling this case?

1. You could create logic that stores the values in a cookie (up to 4kb)
2. i also noticed some sort of websql you could use?

Question 4:
The browser developer tool Firebug Lite uses Local Storage to store preferences. Here is an example of one of the items it stores in Local Storage:

{"options":{
   "saveCookies":true,
   "saveWindowPosition":false,
   "saveCommandLineHistory":false,
   "startOpened":true,
   "startInNewWindow":false,
   "showIconWhenHidden":true,
   "overrideConsole":true,
   "ignoreFirebugElements":true,
   "disableWhenFirebugActive":true,
   "disableXHRListener":false,
   "disableResourceFetching":false,
   "enableTrace":false,
   "enablePersistent":false},
 "persistedState":{
   "isOpen":true,
   "height":200,
   "sidePanelWidth":350,
   "selectedPanelName":"DOM",
   "selectedHTMLElementId":"8",
   "htmlSelectionStack":[],
   "commandHistory":[],
   "commandPointer":-1}
 }
Describe in your own words what kind of value this is.

these are persistent settings for the configuration/options for using the firebug lite plug in. that way your settings are already configured for next time you open the plug in.
