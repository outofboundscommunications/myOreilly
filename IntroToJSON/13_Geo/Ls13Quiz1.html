Question 1:
Explain in your own words what roles the success callback handler function (the first argument to getCurrentPosition()) and 
the error callback handler function (the second argument to getCurrentPosition()) play in the Geolocation API.

1. the success callback handler function, getLocation(position), is called when the browser has retrieved your location.
Its job is to return the latitude and longitude of the user's position. We pass only the definition of the function. The
function is then executed and the value of the function (lat and long) is then returned to the calling function.
2. The error callback function, locationError(error), is called when the browser detects an error. It is then executed and returns an
error status code.

Because functions are first-class objects in JavaScript, we can treat functions like objects, so we can pass functions 
around like variables and return them in functions and use them in other functions. When we pass a callback function 
as an argument to another function, we are only passing the function definition. We are not executing the function in 
the parameter. We arenâ€™t passing the function with the trailing pair of executing parenthesis () like we do 
when we are executing a function.

Question 2:
Of the four methods the browser uses to determine your location, which is typically the most accurate?

The GPS mode is by far the most accurate method.

1. GPS: this is available on many smart phones and other GPS-enabled devices, and is the most accurate way to get
your location. These devices use data from satellites to get your location. In these devices, the browser has access
your location. These devices use data from satellites to get your location. In these devices, the browser has access
to the GPS information.
2. Cell Phone Tower Triangulation: If you're on a cell phone without GPS,the cell
phones can still get a rough idea of your location by seeing which cell phone towers can see your phone. The more
towers you're near, the more accurate your location will be.
3. WiFi: Like cell phone tower triangulation, WiFi positioning uses one or more WiFi access points to compute your
location. This is handy when you're indoors on your laptop.
4. IP Address: If you're connected to a wired network, then this is the method you'll use (like, on your desktop
computer). In this case, your IP address is mapped to a location via a location database. This has the advantage of
being able to work anywhere, but it's often less accurate, because sometimes the database maps your IP address
to your ISP's location, or your neighborhood, rather than your specific location.


Question 3:
The getCurrentPosition() method of the geolocation object has an optional third parameter, a positionOptions object 
that can contain additional options to affect how Geolocation works. One of the options is named enableHighAccuracy and you use it like this:

function init() {
    if (navigator.geolocation) {
        var positionOptions = {
            enableHighAccuracy: false
        };
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(getMyLocation, locationError, positionOptions);
    }
    else {
        console.log("Sorry, no Geolocation support!");
    }
}   
a. Describe in your own words what you think the enableHighAccuracy property does. 
When the enableHighAccuracy flag is set to its default, 'false', the smartphone will not use the internal gps. when set to 'true',
the phone will take a bit more time and use its internal gps to get an accurate position using satellites.
b. If you're on a desktop machine connected to the internet via an ethernet cable through your ISP, 
do you think that this option will make a difference? No.
What about if you're on a cell phone? maybe. depends on phone and settings.
c. After you do the first project for this lesson, try adding this position option to your program and see if it makes a 
difference in the accuracy of your location.
