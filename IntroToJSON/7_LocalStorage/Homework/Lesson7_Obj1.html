<!--Objective 1:
In the lesson, you learned that the localStorage object uses an associative array to store items. An associative array is similar to a regular array but uses keys instead of numerical indices to keep track of the values. With a regular array, you access an item using its index, like this:
value = myArray[i];

where i is a number less than the length of the array.

With an associative array, you can access an item using its key, like this:

value = myAssocArray[key];        
      
using the key just like you would an index, with the [ ] notation. You can use this notation with the localStorage object to access values associated with a key instead of the getItem() method. They both do the same thing.

Rewrite the showAllPrefs() function from the lesson to use the [ ] notation to access the value associated with a key in localStorage. Test it with your prefs application to make sure it works.

Here is the existing version of showAllPrefs():

function showAllPrefs() {
    for (var i = 0; i < localStorage.length; i++) {
        key = localStorage.key(i);
        value = localStorage.getItem(key);
        addToList(key, value);
    }  
When your project is working to your satisfaction, hand in your html and js files.-->
