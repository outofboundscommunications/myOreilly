<!--Question 1:
How can using a document fragment improve your code?

Document fragments make your code faster by allowing you to update the DOM in one execution rather than updating the DOM each time you have a change. You can add many elements to a document fragment and then we you are done, you add the document fragment to the actual DOM. Much more efficient.  The fragment is literally virtual, not really a DOM node.

DocumentFragments allow developers to place child elements onto an arbitrary node-like parent, allowing for node-like interactions without a true root node.  Doing so allows developers to produce structure without doing so within the visible DOM -- an increase of speed is the true advantage. (reference: http://davidwalsh.name/documentfragment).

Question 2:
Why do you think it's important that the document fragment itself is not added to the DOM, but rather only the elements contained within the fragment?

By only adding the daughter elements, that allows you to have a 'blank slate' document fragment ready again for your next iteration of adding elements. you can use the same document fragment container over and over again.


Question 3:
If you want an element to be visible in the page immediately after creating it, should you add it to the DOM or add it to a document fragment?

I would guess it depends on how many elements you are adding to the fragment before you add the fragment to the DOM. I think you could add it to the body or frameset in an onload event as well.

Question 4:
How do you know when an element has been added to the DOM?

when a user can see that element on the page visually. You could also view the DOM structure and search for that element.
