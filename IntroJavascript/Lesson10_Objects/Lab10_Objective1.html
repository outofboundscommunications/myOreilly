  Objective 1:
Write a program that creates an array of Movie objects, and then displays the movie information in a web page. Your movie object should contain at least the following properties:

title (a string)
year (a number)
genre (a string)
rating (a number between 1 and 5)
showtimes (an array of strings, like ["3:00pm", "5:00pm"])
Create at least three movie objects in your array. You can pick whichever movies you like (use Wikipedia or IMDB if you need help with movie ideas!). Then, loop through all the movies in the array and display at least the movie title, year, and showtimes in the "movies" <div>.
