Question 1:
What's the difference between an object and a property?

An object is an unordered collection of properties, each of which has a name and a value. 

An example of an object is:

var myObject {

name: 
Question 2:

If you had to describe your car as an object, what kinds of properties would it have?

Question 3:

Given this object constructor function:

function House(stories, bedrooms, bathrooms, squareFeet) { 
 this.stories = stories; 
 this.bedrooms = bedrooms; 
 this.bathrooms = bathrooms; 
 this.squareFeet = squareFeet; 
}
  

Show the code to create a House object representing a 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom, 2-story house, with 1100 square feet, and put it in the variable, myHouse.
Question 4:

Open a browser window and load a web page, say http://google.com. Now open the developer console. At the JavaScript prompt, type:

  window.innerWidth
  

Record the result. Now reduce the width of your browser a bit, and do it again. Record the new width.

    Is innerWidth a property? If so, what object is it a property of?
    What do you think the value of the innerWidth property represents?
