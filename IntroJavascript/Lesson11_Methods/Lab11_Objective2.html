 /*
	Objective 2:
	Add a method named getLikes() to the Pet object that returns a string containing the values of the likes array. Then use this method to update your web page so the "pets" <div> displays a string like "Willie likes slobbering, panting, eating." Notice there is a comma inserted between the items from the likes array.
	Include comments in the code explaining what you're doing and why.
	Submit your file once you have it working.
