Question 1:
To get the value of a text input or a textarea form control, what property of the form control element do you use?

var descriptionTextarea = document.getElementById("description");		
var description = descriptionTextarea.value;
      
Question 2:
What array do you use to get the value of a select form control?

var genreSelect = document.getElementById("genre");					//stores entire <select> element
var genreOption = genreSelect.options[genreSelect.selectedIndex];	// use selectedIndex property of <select> element to determine option (arrray element) selected
var genre = genreOption.value; 										// Store the value of array element in genre

Question 3:
If the user types a number into a text input or a textarea form control and you want to use that value as a number (say, to add to or subtract from another number), how would you convert the string from the form control to a number?

  var textInput = document.getElementById("theText"); // get text from DOM
  var myText = textInput.value;
  var myNumber = parseInt(mytext.value);	// get value from element, convert to number


Question 4:
In the movie example from the lesson, suppose you want to perform certain actions if a user entered a comedy and gave it the highest rating (5). What would you use for the if statement?

 if (title == null || title == "") {		// make sure title not empty
        alert("Please enter a movie title");
        return;
      }
	  
	  if (genre == "comedy" && rating ==5)	{	// take an action if genre is comedy and rating is 5
		  alert("wow, whats up with the great rating?");
	  }
      else {									
        var movie = new Movie(title, rating, genre, description);	// create movie object using movie constructor
        movieList.push(movie);					// put the movie object into the movieList array
        var movies = document.getElementById("movies");
        movies.innerHTML = "Added " + movie.title + " to the list.";
      
	  	 var theForm = document.getElementById("theForm");	// clear the form values before submitting next list object
        theForm.reset();
	  }
